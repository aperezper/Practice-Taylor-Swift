<p> <strong> Taylor Alison Swift </strong> (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_Swift_albums_discography">discography</a> spans multiple genres, and her narrative songwritingâ€”often inspired by her personal lifeâ€”has received critical praise and widespread media coverage. <br>
Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift relocated to Nashville, Tennessee, at the age of 14 to pursue a career in  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_music">country music</a>. She signed a songwriting contract with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording deal with Big Machine Records in 2005, before releasing her eponymous debut studio album in 2006.</p>

<p>Swift explored country pop on the albums Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010); the success of the singles "Love Story" and "You Belong with Me" on both country and pop radio established her as a leading crossover artist. 
<br> She experimented with rock and electronic genres on her fourth studio album, Red (2012), supported by the singles <em>"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together"</em> and <em>"I Knew You Were Trouble"</em>. Swift eschewed country on her synth-pop album 1989 (2014) and its chart-topping tracks "Shake It Off", "Blank Space", and "Bad Blood". The media scrutiny on Swift's life inspired Reputation (2017), which drew from urban sounds. <u><strong>Led by "Look What You Made Me Do", the album made Swift the only act in MRC Data history to have four albums each sell over a million copies in a week.</strong></u></p>
